; Ledger directly supports "timelog" entries, which have this form:

; i 2013/03/28 22:13:00 ACCOUNT[  PAYEE]
; o 2013/03/29 03:39:00

; This records a check-in to the given ACCOUNT, and a check-out. You can be
; checked-in to multiple accounts at a time, if you wish, and they can span
; multiple days (use --day-break to break them up in the report). The number of
; seconds between check-in and check-out is accumulated as time to that ACCOUNT.
; If the checkout uses a capital 'o', the transaction is marked "cleared". You
; can use an optional PAYEE for whatever meaning you like.

; Now, there are a few ways to generate this information. You can use the
; timeclock.el package, which is part of Emacs. Or you can write a simple script
; in whichever language you prefer to emit similar information. Or you can use
; Org s time-clocking abilities and the org2tc script developed by John Wiegley.

; These timelog entries can appear in a separate file, or directly in your main
; ledger file. The initial 'i' and 'o' characters count as Ledger "directives",
; and are accepted anywhere that ordinary transactions are valid.
